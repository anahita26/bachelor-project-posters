# Bachelor's Project Posters

This repository showcases two posters from my undergraduate studies in Mechanical Engineering at Georgia Tech. 

## Capstone Project
**Title**: SteakCheck - Doneness via Weightloss
**Description**: This poster summarizes the key experimentation and findings of my senior design project. The project involved developing a non-invasive device that displays the doneness of a steak.

## Undergraduate Research Symposium
**Title**: Optimizing the Faradaic Efficiency of CO2 Reduction to Formic Acid
**Description**: This poster was presented at the Georgia Tech Undergraduate Research Spring Symposium. This research focused on converting captured CO2 into value added products to promote a circular economy. I completed this work as a research assistant in the Circular Electrochemistry Lab under the guidance of Dr. Marta Hazell.
